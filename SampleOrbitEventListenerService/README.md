# Sample Orbit Event Listener Service #
## Overview ##
This sample is intended to demonstrate how to build a Windows Service that listens and reacts to Orbit events. This project is a sample only in the sense that the code is meant to be modified to meet the the integration needs of each particular business; however, it is written and follows practices with the intention of being production ready.

This service can be deployed on-premise allowing integration with on-premise resources and services.

## How To Customize ##

The SampleOrbitEventListenerService/MessageHandlers folder contains sample message handlers. You can create new message handlers or modify one of the samples
that matches your needs. You can delete the message handlers you don't need (or leave them, if you'd prefer).
